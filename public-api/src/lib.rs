//! This library gives you a the public API of a library crate, in the form of a
//! list of public items in the crate. Public items are items that other crates
//! can use.
//!
//! As input to the library, a special output format from `cargo doc` is used,
//! which goes by the name **rustdoc JSON**. Currently, only `cargo doc` from
//! the Nightly toolchain can produce **rustdoc JSON** for a library. You build
//! **rustdoc JSON** like this:
//!
//! ```bash
//! RUSTDOCFLAGS='-Z unstable-options --output-format json' cargo +nightly doc --lib --no-deps
//! ```
//!
//! The main entry point to the library is [`public_api_from_rustdoc_json_str`],
//! so please read its documentation.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! The two main use cases are listing the public API and diffing different
//! versions of the same public APIs.
//!
//! ## List all public items of a crate (the public API)
//! ```
#![doc = include_str!("../examples/list_public_api.rs")]
//! ```
//!
//! ## Diff two versions of a public API
//! ```
#![doc = include_str!("../examples/diff_public_api.rs")]
//! ```
//!
//! The most comprehensive example code on how to use the library can be found
//! in the thin binary wrapper around the library, see
//! <https://github.com/Enselic/public-api/blob/main/src/main.rs>.
